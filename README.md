🌿 Project Overview

In this final project, I created a shopping cart application for an online plant shop that offers a variety of house plants.

The Paradise Nursery shopping cart features include:

- A landing page with a button linking to the product listing page

- A navigation bar with links to the landing page, product listing page, and shopping cart page

- A card for each plant showcasing its image, name, description, cost, and an Add to Cart button

- At least two sections describing different categories of plants (e.g., Aromatic Plants and Medicinal Plants)

- A cart page displaying the products added to the cart

- A cart card for each plant type, showing:

    - Thumbnail

    - Unit cost

    - Total cost per plant type

    - Buttons to increase/decrease quantity

    - A Delete button

- Continue Shopping and Checkout buttons

✅ Learning Outcomes

After completing this lab, I was able to:

- React Components: Create functional React components using component composition and nesting

- State Management with Hooks: Implement React Hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage component-level state and control UI behavior

- Redux Integration: Integrate Redux into the application using actions, reducers, and the Redux store

- Rendering Dynamic Data: Dynamically render data from arrays of objects using the map() function

- Event Handling & Conditional Rendering: Handle user interactions and conditionally render UI elements based on application state
